I only go for the jjigae and occasionally order the bulgogi. They are called a tofu restaurant for a reason. They have the best korean tofu soups in town. Very flavorful broth loaded with silken tofu. Served in a bubbling stone bowl- drop in that raw egg for a perfectly poached egg. The menu has several jjigaes so you get to order the soup with any base of your choosing (pork, kimchee, seafood). You also choose the spice level. Served with unlimited banchan and you have an amazing spread of korean food before you. After going to korea- I realized this restaurant is not "authentic" but I don't care. The jjgaes are bomb- I'll have it anytime. Now the other items on the menu are a hit or miss. The five star rating is only based on the soups. The bulgogi is different from other Korean restaurants- in a good way. They use thin strips of pork which allow for the sauce to soak in and the meat to be tender. It served on a hot plate so it stays hot. This place serves a great warm homemade feeling meal. Servers are constantly changing but they are always super attentive and never fail to ask if you want a refill on banchan.</div>

                    <div id="review-body">The food here is also pretty good. They are generous with giving the banchan side dishes and huge clay pots of rice. My fiance and I both ordered combos of grilled meat and tofu stew - the spicy barbecue chicken was really well-marinated and cooked perfectly. The tofu stews used huge pieces of tofu that were obviously high quality.</div>
